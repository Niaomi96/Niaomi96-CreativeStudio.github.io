<ul>
2 months has passed and the pups was now 6 months old, and the parents knew their 
personalities very well. Vitalis and GreyStorm took the pups to nearby creek that had fish in it, 
but most importantly space for pups to run an play.
<br>
<p>Mmamotse: [seen a fish in the water, she watches it, then she pounces for fish but it 
quickly gets away. She chases it but it was to fast and the water was slowing her down, she 
gives up and sits down panting. ]</p>
<p>Leviticus : [ was nibbling on a stick. He gets up only to find Airmead has started a tug of 
war with him, they pull growling at one another playfully.]
</p>
<p>GreyStorm: [ decided to show Mmamotse on how to catch a fish, he walks up to her 
show her how it's done, Leviticus drops the stick and joins them. Vitalis was busy grooming 
herself. ]</p>
<p>Airmead:[was to busy staring at a dragonfly watching it zig-ga in mid air. It lands on 
her noses and then took off in the opposite direction away from everyone else. She runs after
it, jumping and biting at it but it kept coughing her.]</p>
<br>
Meanwhile back at the creek....
<br>
<p>Mmamotse and Leviticus got the hang of catching fish and know was splashing and 
running around in the water.
</p>
<p>Vitalis: [ looked, to only see Leviticus and Mmamotse with GreyStorm. ]" 
Airmead??!?!?"</p>
<br>
Everyone stopped what they was doing .
<br>
<p>Vitalis:” GreyStorm, I can’t find Airmead anywhere. “[she said with worry]</p>
<p>GreyStorm: [gets up.]” I will go look for her, stay here with the others.”</p>

Meanwhile …

<br>
<p>Airmead:[lost track of the dragon fly along time ago, feeling lost, but not afraid. 
Not until she heard a twig snapped behind her . She looks behind her, feeling scared now. A
large cat comes out of hiding running at her. She starts running for her life. The pup started 
slowing down and the cat was gaining, it pounces on Airmead. She yelped and started fighting 
back, even losing the tip of her ear. ]</p>

no time snatching the cat off his daughter, the cat scratched him in face which made him 
dropped drop the cat. He stood between Airmead and the Cat. He growl bearing his fangs, 
the cat was pasting back and forth.</p>
<p>Airmead: [ shivered in fear and whimpering, not paying attention to the blood that was 
on her face.]
</p>
<p>The cat gave up the chase, and left. GreyStorm walked back with Airmead shivering, 
when she seen her mother she ran to her and berried her face into her mother’s chest.</p>
<p>Vitalis: [cleaned the blood off Airmead’s face, she wanted to Reprimand her daughter 
for leaving without an adult. However, she just happy she alive hear with her and not in a 
belly of a cat. She gets up once Airmead has fallen asleep, and went to clean the claw marks that 
went down his eye. He was lucky to not lose his eye.]
</p>
<p>GreyStorm: [lays down as she groomed his face then she started grooming his neck 
which made him wag his tail, even though he can’t produce pups anymore, he was still content 
and happy to have his own pack away from his brother.]
</p>
<p>Morning came shining through the canopy of the trees. Vitalis and GreyStorm, left the 
pups at the lake and went hunting for breakfast. Few minutes later the pups woken up.</p>
