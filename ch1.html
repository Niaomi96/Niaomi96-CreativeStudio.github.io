  <h3>Unexpected Part 1</h3>
  <p>
A young she wolf, follows the male that she fell deeply in loved with. The male, shown the 
same affection for her , his name was Osiris, however he had a dark sinister vide to him after 
courting the young she wolf for some time, she became pregnant. He fed her well, but noticed 
her tummy wasn't large, and he wanted a large family, he stopped showing affection for 
the young she wolf, and only fed her ,while also distancing himself from her. Osiris had met 
another female and also breed to her , he kept this a secret from Vitalis, and her tummy was 
far more larger then hers , he will only stay if her litter was large, and she could just be 
sporting a small tummy.</p>  <br>

<p>On an full moon night , she gave birth to three little pups , her adversary gave birth to five 
the next following day.</p><br>


<p>Osiris: [he tracks one of his two females, first to see what Vitalis produce][he finds her very 
hidden den so well he had to back track several times. ][ as he sticks his head into the den 
,Vitalis comes out ,using all her energy to attack the intruder to protect her pups.] "Easy !! It me ,Osiris!"
</p>

<p>. Vitalis: [wags tails once she realized it was him.]</p>
<p>Osiris:" Here's a deer leg."[ As he places it down , he watches her wolf it down, knowing he 
wont be able to see the pups until , they come outside. ]</p>
<p>Vitalis: " Thank you , for the food , love." </p><br>
[As she turns back and begins entering her den.]<br>
<p>Osiris: " Your welcome."[he turns and walks away. He leaves ,and go find his other mate Dawn. 
He stumbles over her den very easily. However, just like Vitalis's reaction, he couldn't enter 
the den , he also gave her deer leg.] </p>
<p>Dawn:" I should have found more secluded den, but the labor disable my ability to go far."</p>
<p>Osiris:[snuggles her]" Don't worry, Dawn. We will move them later once your strength is up."</p>

both territories] " At least the girls are protective of the pups, makes my job easier, until I 
see who has the largest litter."[after marking both territories, he finds a good spot to rest.]</p><br>
 Osiris return to both dens every day, mean while Vitalis, pups eyes has open, was started 
trying to walk in the den, some stumble and some lay there whining in frustration. She 
watches as there walking gotten stronger. [Fade out screen] today was the first day they come 
out the den she pokes her head out and scanned for danger , and comes out the den. She lays 
a little way from the entrance of the den, to encourage the littles to come out.<br>
