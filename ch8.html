<ul>

<p>Mmamotse: [ she feels awake in her dream as white soft grass blows gently. She walks 
feeling at peace, unaware she is on the a moon. The stars shining around her seemingly in 
reach of her paws. She makes it to a Florescent lake, Then she was brutally awoken by her 
sister Airmead. She groggily looks up at her sister, like she gotten no rest at all during the 
night.]
</p>
<p>Airmead: “Good ,your awake, we have some exploring to do.”[ She had a smug look on her 
face]</p>
<p>Mmamotse: [ gets up and yawns, then stretches. Then followed her siblings on there next 
adventure. ]</p>
<br>
The pups made it to the beach, they seen weird animal on beach, that has flippers.
<br>
<p>Mmamotse: [ approach a smaller version of it, and sniffed it, then picked up , it had its mouth 
open to bit her ,but she puts it in the water , thinking it was miss shaped fish. The turtle gets 
taken by the waves. ]</p>
<p>Leviticus : [ gets distracted by a crab passing by, still remembering what happen to his nose 
when he was a pup, he decided to make it his lunch, however, the crab bested him again but 
it got hold of his ear which made him run around, whining in distress. ]</p>
<p>Airmead: [sat there watching her brother , run and rolling on the ground trying to get the 
crab off, she gets up and walked to her brother that’s rolling on the ground. ]” Here ,let me 
help.”[ she pulls the crab off and eats it.] “ there , crab no more.”[ she laughs]</p>
<p>Leviticus : [ Glared at his sister while she walked off laughing. ]”Geez sis Thanks.” [ he said in 
grumpy tone while he rolled his eyes.]</p>
<p>Mmamotse: [ Fallen asleep under a palm tree on the beach, her dreams brought her back to the 
florescent lake. She touched it with her paw, which felt surreal as the water touched her paw.
Once she, put her paw onto the water to enter it, she begins walking upon the water, she 
reached the other side of the lake. Where she came to a field of glowing flowers, it was 
calling to her, as she gets closer her eyes begin to shine as she gotten closer. Then she was 
woken by Leviticus.]

<p>Leviticus : [as he had one paw still shaking her, but when her eyes opened her eyes Glowed 
Brightly. ]”s-.”</p>
<p>Mmamotse:” Who dares awaken the goddess of night and day!“[ she shakes her head and 
closed her eyes, then opened her eyes, which turn back to normal.]</p>
<br>
Both Leviticus and Airmead, looking shocked at there sister because she made a loud 
booming voice, but Mmamotse was as much confused as her siblings and don’t remember 
what she said either.
<br>
<p>Airmead:[ cutting the silence held between them.] “ its sunset ,it’s time to go home, let’s 
go.”</p>
<p>The three of them , went on home passing the icy fortress before them. Once, home they all 
went to sleep.
</p>
<p>Mmamotse: [ she was drawn to the flowers once more in her dreams . She touches a flower 
which enveloped her body, she wakes up panting, not understanding what the dream 
means. She claims down, and goes back to sleep, but the dream doesn’t reoccur. ]
</p>
<p>Mmamotse: [ was up a little early before the sunrise and her family, she had hard time staying 
a sleep. She watches the sun rise and shine over the tree line before her, she felt empowered 
by the sun rays. ]</p>
<p>Airmead :[ wakes up seeing her sister, and brother gone off without her. She felt left out, 
then got mad.] “ Fine! , I will go on my own adventure. “[ she walked off.]</p>
<p>Leviticus : [ went off on his on, to have some me time, as he’s always with his sisters, and its 
starting to get boring. ]</p>

<p>Mmamotse: [ was out hunting a small deer on her own, tufted deer was getting closer and 
closer to her hidden spot.]</p>
<p>Airmead:[ sat under a tree bored waiting for anything to happen.]
</p>
<p>Mmamotse: [ rushes out and snagged the small deer quickly and efficiently. She eats her first 
hunt, without her siblings on her own. Her practice to work with her short tail has paid off in 
the long run. She waste nothing , then heads home.]</p>
<p>Airmead:[ was already home and asleep. ]</p>
<p>Leviticus : [ also head home, until he was stopped by a wolf in his path. ]” who are you?”</p>
<p>Osiris: “ Your father, Young Male. I’m impressed of how large and muscular you have be 
came, it makes me proud. “[ he said with a Smile on his face. ]
</p>
<p>Leviticus : [ Looks at him but don’t show his distain for Osiris. He walks passed him without 
another word.]
</p>
<p>Osiris:” oh, so you believe in the lies your, mother has told you about me.” [ He said with a 
smirk on his face.]</p>
