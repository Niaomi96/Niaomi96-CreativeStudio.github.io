<p>Anubis: [ Approaches the young she wolf consciously, they started walking around 
one another sniffing and such.]( play the song Thousands Years)</p>
<p>Leviticus :[ trying to avoid locking eyes on any nearby unexpected females , ran into 
one he was memorized by her.]
</p>
<p>Mmamotse:[ also locked eyes with two males which was brothers. ]</p>
<p>Airmead: [ she was all alone , she puts ears back and sits alone. Then she hears a 
twig snapped behind her, she turned around and seen a wolf, she gets up happily. ]
</p>
<br style="text-font-size: bold;">
