 Wind gusts swirl and weave through the sweet autumn trees making leaves fall and the
branches barren, and unfruitful. The wind blows through the she wolf fur, she sighs in relief as
she looks over to their pack male that produces with all females many females having young of
their own. She grooms her overgrown belly, she gets up and goes and greets her pack protector,
she runs her head on his then leaves the pack to find a safe place to deliver her precious unborn
pups. This place may be peaceful and safe, however it's far from it. Other males will give
nothing to take over her pack and slaughter their young. The she wolf climbs a tree into a den,
as she has been making a nest for quite some time in the tree hollow. She enters and rolls
around and prepares herself for a long day, as she pants heavily, she feels secluded and safe in
her nest</pre>

   Few hours later a single pup was born into this world, she was covered in black and brown
coat. She nurses on her mother as the only pup she will get the best start in life. The mother
grooms her bundle of joy, however, was highly alert and aware of her surroundings. The little
pup will have to earn her name in a right of passage. The pup purrs as it is now asleep and
wrapped around by her mother. Two weeks have passed since the little female was born and
her eyes are starting to open. Everything seems blurry and the light glistening on the side of her
eyes wasn't very helpful to her. She rubs her eyes and whimpers she was alone in the den at
this time, she gives off a cute puppy yawn/ whine.

   <p style=" color:#e2bfe0; " >
The newborn pup's mom was out hunting, she knew the risk of leaving her pups alone at the
den as she couldn't protect her young back at the den. She was on the cliff, stalking down a
herd of mountain goats. They haven't noticed her yet. Back at the den. The little female was
comfortable in her nest of moses and bird feathers, she nibbles on her paw wondering why the
world is so bright but she can't see any of it. Beneath the little female was a lone male not
knowing there was a pup a few meters above him. He lays under the tree and stretches. He's
been checking out this area for a while, but the dominant male was <strong><i>large</i></strong> and <i>powerful</i>. This
pack had a group of three females and one male, very typical pack, for the mountain range. Back
at the cliff, her mother has finally given chase to mountain goats, they flee by scattering, but
her mother has one insight, it was one that has a broken back leg, and wasn't extending it's
leg properly. However, it was still swift and jumped off the cliff plumbing down to ground
below. The she wolf jumps after it, and instead of slowing her fall she dives. She snags the goat
in mid air before they hit the ground and she lands onto her paws. She looks around making
sure her pack male didn't hear her success or her pack of sisters. She drags her black goat into
the nearby bushes and feeds. The male gets a whiff of the tiny pup inside the tree, he sniffs
around it.. climbing isn't the male's strong suit, but they still can if they were determined
enough to. In order for this young rogue to take over this pack, he will have to kill the original
male's young, yet he didn't know the mother had finished her hunt and was making her way
back home to her den. The male sniffs higher standing on his hind legs, stretching and
reaching for the smell that held his attention.
  </p><br>
    <p style=" color:#e2bfe0; " >
Then all of a sudden he was slammed to the ground by an angry mother that almost
ripped his throat out as he retreated as the female chased him completely out of the pack's
territory. The male huffs and puffs trying to catch his breath, every male's terror is facing or
getting mauled by an angry mother. The mother of the pup rushes into the den seeing her pup
still very much alive sucking on her paw. Her mother picked her up and held her in her mouth
taking her out of the tree den, she chanced it by staying for too long in this den. She held the
two week old pup in her mouth gently and carefully and climbed down and abandoned her tree
den. She walks along looking for a suitable den to house her precious cargo. The little pup
bounced up and down while her mother walked with bounce in her step, proud that not only
did she defend her den but stopped a potential massacre of her pack. She stops when she sees
some very thick bushes and places her little pup into the bushes, she lays down and grooms her
pup. The little pup whines and complains as she didn't want to be bathed but wanted to nurse.
Few weeks had passed and the little female was walking and following her mom to new dens
instead of being carried. Their new den was near a lake, the little female watched the ducks
swim, curious to know what they were and wanted to know why it was walking on water,
instead of land. Her mother came and asked,'' What are you up to little one?" The little she
wolf looks up at her mother with the most inspiration and states," watching the animals that
walk on water," she giggles. "Silly one, they aren't walking on water, but swimming," mother
stated. The little female looks confused and perplexed by what her mother is saying to her,
"Mom, what is swimming?" "Swimming is when you're in the water and you kick your legs to
move around. Now my little one it's time for you, to go into hiding as momma has to hunt,"
mother stated, as she nudged her little one into her hiding place, and left her to go hunt.

  </p><br>
   <p style=" color:#e2bfe0; " >
The little female emerges from the tall autumn grass she then runs around popping in and
out of the grass. She noticed a tree and started climbing it, but not too high as she didn't have
the strength to even go that high yet. After staying close to the hiding spot she went over to the
lake thinking of what her mother said to her earlier, " They don't walk on water they swim." She
went over to the lake that was in front of her and jumped right in, but quickly realized
swimming is harder than it appeared to be. She whines," <i>HELP</i>." Her mother heard her cries
for help, her ear swiveled in her direction, she began to panic, her heart racing and her mind
running a thousand thoughts in her head. "Is it a male attacking her? What if I don't make it to
her in time." She muttered under her breath. Her mother stopped at their hiding spot and
looked frantically around, when she saw her pup go under the water. "Oh My Goodness!", she
screamed and went into the water after her. The little female started falling to the bottom of
the lake, she tried to swim her way up, but she couldn't and she was running out of time. She
felt her lungs constrict, she needed to inhale, she was about to, when her mother pulled her out
the water. She gasped frantically. She panicked at first, not realizing what was happening, then
she looked up and saw her mother holding her and taking her to safety. Her mother placed
her down, glaring at her, and she smiled with ears back. " But mama, I just wanted to swim
like the ducks," she said while lowering her head, "Don't ever do that again, you could have
drowned," she stated with heavy breathing. She realized her little one was very much afraid,
she nearly drowned. She cups her daughter's cheek with one of her big paws, and places her
head onto her daughter's head. She leads her away from the water edge. The she wolf grooms
her soaked pup dry, also stimulating her to breathe more and to sooth her. Her daughter falls
asleep in her arms. She had a very traumatic, but fun day.

Two months have passed, and now a cold chill has gripped the mountain range. The little
female woke up alone, as her mother had gone out to hunt. She looks around and sees this
thick haze has fallen up her surroundings, she goes to the bank of the lake and lays next to it.
She was very curious about what was swimming underneath the lake. She shoves her head into
the water holding her breath, she watches fish swimming by. Her tail wags, in a mischievous
way, she pulls her head out and shakes her coat. She walked into a shallow part of the lake and
splashed around in it. She comes out and shakes her coat once more then climbs the tree that
was near where her mother always leaves her to go hunt. She makes it to split ways of the tree
trunk and climbs higher. Then she lays in its branches purring as she watches the fog
dispatch slowly but surely, putting her to sleep. After her nap, she climbed down, and noticed
a single song bird, pulling up a worm. She started stalking it, practicing her skills she will
someday need in life. She was so close, but the bird spotted her and took flight, she stalked and
waited too long to strike, she was also very noisy. However, the bird kept getting its worm as it
saw the young predator as naive and incapable of harming it, till she got close enough to it,
that's when it retreated, and retreat it did, it landed on a rock and ate its worm, right in front of
the little female, then flew away. Her tummy begins to grumble, and just on time mom has
returned but she had something special for her little one. The little female comes running to her
mother. She stops abruptly not sure what that thing is in her mom's mouth, she looks
curiously at it. She drops the boar leg in front of her daughter, she wags her tail and hopes this
will encourage her to try her first taste of meat. The little female paws at it then pounces on it
not sure if it's a toy or food but it smelt amazing to her. She bits it while she licks it with her
back legs. The taste of the flesh made her stop playing with it but eat it instead. She swatted at
her mother, blocking her with her tiny body. Her mother giggles and smiles, as she knows soon
she will be meeting the pack soon, and this is good because she will have to fight for her food at
the carcass. The little female eats as much as she can of the meat before getting full, her
mother sits and eats the remaining meat of the leg she gave her daughter, it is very dangerous
to bring food to a den site it attracts other predators and she not big enough yet to defend
herself, as she did that, her pup nursed on her. She grooms her daughter, then she gets up and
stretches, the little female was sound asleep. The mother goes and drinks some water at the
lake. She looks out into the vast lake that was a part of their territory. She lays down next to
her daughter , and rests. The next morning her mother led her little one to a new hiding spot. It
was long overdue, the little she wolf wasn't happy about the new hiding spot and mopped all
the way there. They stopped next to the cliffs, and her mother started climbing up them. The
little female had to keep up which was hard for her to do because she was yet so tall. She
whines to her mother to pick her up instead, but she ignores her. She tries to get over this tall
gravel loosely rock that is always carved underneath her paws which made her stuck and her
mother waited for her at the top. She noticed a very small winding tree. She climbed onto it and
the branches creaked and groaned from her weight. She makes it to the top and rubs on her
mother purring, her mother grooms her. Now her mother was in her hunting grounds, the
perfect place to hide her young. Very soon she will be having her follow her closely in order to
feed. She won't be joining the pack for another month, so it's important for her to learn to keep
up or perish as they aren't the only predators here in these mountains. Giant spirit bear comes
wandering through the area, grazing on some grass. The little female never saw them in her life
and was memorized by the massive beast eating grass. Mother gives off a low growl, as she lost
her previous litter to bears during a hunting trip. She softly whispered to herself, and grooms
her daughter that was nursing on her.

  </p><br>
   <p style=" color:#e2bfe0; " >
The little female was fast asleep on her mother's side purring like always on her mommy's
stomach, she rolls onto her back exposing her stomach feeling safe and secure, as it should be.
The sun set over the horizon of the misty fog that was now set upon the lands, the mother
watches the sunset among the haze of fog that soon thickens around them. Nothing she hasn't
seen before. That's not what is troubling her, the fog hides the threats to her ospring. She places
her sleeping pup into a crevice where she should be hidden and safe from danger. Then she
leaves to use the fog to her advantage, as she couldn't resist the prospect of an easy and swift
kill.

  <p style=" color:#e2bfe0; " >
Meanwhileâ€¦

  </p><br>
  <p style=" color:#e2bfe0; " >
Few minutes after her mother left, she woke up to all the hood prints walking above her. She
decided to go check it out. She popped her head out but everything was so foggy and she
couldn't see what was in front of her or behind her. Nevertheless, she comes out slowly and
consciously. She watches the fog swirl around her, she feels less afraid and more curious than
ever. She turns her head and she comes face to face with a Mountain goat she screams and so
does the goat. It jumped over her and galloped off into the thick fog. It was starting to get
darker after the sun had dipped behind the mountains. She giggles about how she got scared of
a goat, that seemed more afraid of her then she was of it. She heads back into the crevice where
her mother left her. She heard her mother calling her, but didn't see her due to fog. It is also
very dark out, she comes out. She realized her mother wants her to come to where she is. She
walks low to the ground as she follows her mother's calls into the abyss of darkness. Once she
heard her mother much more clearly, she started calling back, but she stopped in her tracks as a
few small rocks pelted her paw. A few minutes later she heard the grunts of a bear, the ominous
sounds of the bear frightened her, she started backing away as the sound got louder and closer.
All of sudden she saw a giant paw, swiping her way, she jumped back and out of the way,
after the paw came, a jaw came out of the foggy abyss and snapped at her with dagger-like teeth
that missed her nearly a few inches away, she runs for her life as she could see what was chasing
her through the fog. Her mother notices her silence but not sure what is happening she calls
more frantically. The little female jumps off the rock she was on. The bear stops abruptly,
almost slipping off the cliff to catch her. She was still falling and couldn't see the ground before
her. She bounces off a ledge which she quickly reaches out for and to her luck and surprise she
grabs a hold of it and pulls herself up onto the ledge. She calls out to her mother and waits and
listens. She got a response, and made her way up to where her mother was. She was visibly
shaken from her experience. "What happened?" The mother wolf stated. "I was being chased by
a monster in fog mom, and I don't know what it was, but it tried to <strong>eat</strong><i>me!</i>" The little female
stated. Her mother rubs on her, happy she survived a bear attack all on her own, but was very
scared for her safety. " The monster you speak of is a bear, they will eat you, so be careful and
watchful of your surroundings when I'm not around. I am so proud of you, escaping a bear
attack all on your own." Mother stated. After being claimed down by her mother. She heads over
to the carcass of the goat, and eats it. All that fleeing made her hungry and tired. She eats her
fill as her mother ate with her. After they ate they groomed one another. The fog finally starts to
dissipate and her mother leads her away from kill to find a place for them to sleep tonight. She
follows her mother but also biting her tail which slows down their progress a little. Mother
turns around and they start playing with one another as of right now she's her only play mate.
After playing, she leads her rambunctious pup to a new spot on the cliffs and they get
comfortable to sleep and that's what they did was fall into a deep sleep, as the song of the night
lulls them to sleep.
