One month has passed since her mother brought her onto the cliffs to have her keep up
with her. But now it was time to leave the cliffs and the danger of the bears of the mountains.
She noticed less and less bears in the area, as autumn has fully congressed into full blown
winter. The slopes of the mountains are covered in snow and she loved it as she ran around
jumping and pouncing into the white fluffy snow that covered the cliffs. They make it down the
cliffs onto the lower land of the great plains as there was also snow covering everything and
the lake has frozen over. She follows her mother as her curiosity has grown. She noticed her
mother was calling to something and she heard calls coming back to her which sound different
from mom's. They started picking up past as they crunched through the frozen grasses
beneath their paws. The snow did slow down the little female by a lot. She started to slack
behind which caused her mother to stop and watch and wait for her to get next to her again.
Mother slowed down as she noticed her pup was struggling through the deep snow. As they
made their way back into the forest, trees had no leaves and some were frozen over with ice
and some with snow covering their branches. As they're walking in the forest the snow was less
deep and easier for the little female to keep up with her mother. They come to a big winding
oak tree where wolves lie with their young and very large male wolf that sat somewhat away
from the female and their young of many different ages. The little female stayed close to her
mother as she picked up pace. The she wolves stood up and greeted their returning sister. Then
turn their attention to the tiny pup she brought with her, the first pup they saw successfully
come home with her. The little female growled and backed away underneath her mother. One
of the females laughed, "She's a feisty one, no wonder why she survived, " she stated. Mother
smiled, showing how proud she was to have pup to bring home. After a while of greeting the
females and getting use to them the little female became more accepting of her new life, but she
was very curious of the big male laying away from her. She cautiously goes up to a large male.
Which sniffed her over and she paws at his face giggling. She then breaks free and goes to play
with the other pups in the pack. Which was lots of fun for her. She pounces, kicks, bit, slap,
and stalks them. What wasn't fun is when the larger bigger ones joined in. After having a day of
fun. She had two cousins she seemed to bond with the most out of their play time, where they
tended to play with one another the most. Being back in the pack after four months away from
her sisters and mate, she can now hunt in groups and not alone anymore. When the females left
the male was with the pups to go hunting, while the pups were asleep at that time, however, not
for long. They ran around and played.
