  <h3>The Secret Forest Part 1</h3>
  <p>
<ul>
All three pups went to the rocky crest , that’s apart of the great was on the island, pica was still 
active during the winter and it be great way to practice there hunting skills. Mmamotse, had 
got accustom to her scars on her body and missing half of her tail, she mastered hunting 
without the long tail. However, she was still insurance about how she looked, she felt as 
though she never get an eye laid upon her when the day comes to find your own mate. They 
was now 11 months of age now.
<br>
<p>Airmead: [ rush over to the pica, then that made the pica sound the alarm, and all hide.]
</p>
<p>Mmamotse: [went to hide, and wait for the pica to reappear.]
</p>
<p>Leviticus : [ Joined his sister in hiding. ]</p>
<p> Airmead: [ gave up the chased and hide like her sister and brother.]</p>
<br>
The picas came back out and started foraging again. 
<br>
<p>Mmamotse: [ started the hunt, and rushed out of the shrubbery.]</p>
<p>Airmead: [ Jumps from behind an rock, which cut the pica off from the rocky out crops. ]</p>
<p>Leviticus :[ lying in wait , snatches the pica up , once it ran towards up.]</p>
<p>The pups , tugged on the now dead pica trying to get the pica for themselves. Leviticus won 
the tug of war and had eaten the pica whole. The pups went onto the rocky out Crest, playing 
snatch the pica. Then all of a sudden, the group gave way the pups and the unlucky pica fell 
into a underground cave system. The pups woken up 2hrs later, but ok, the picas ran off after 
they woken up.</p>

  <p>
<ul>

<p>Mmamotse: [ licks her paw and looked up, and see how high the whole was from the ground. ]</p>
<p>Leviticus :[ gets up and found scars on his nose from the rock shards, he, grooms his wood 
clean , since the blood stop oozing.]</p>
<p>Airmead: [ was to busy rubbing her head from the pain, but no blood ]
</p>
<br>
After the pups the pups felt a little better they knew they couldn’t go up, so they went into the 
near by cave opening and walk along the florescent lights coming off the cave walls. Which 
lead them to a hidden oasis, the pups rush over to the water and lapped up the water. They 
was amazed by how beautiful this place was, light shining down from the Eroded cave ceiling. 
The pups begin exploring ,but also to find the way out, since they was in unknown places they 
stayed close to one another.
<br>
<p>Mmamotse: [ walked along, with her siblings , as she walks down the stone steps, it brings 
her to these beautiful flowers they glow while she approaches. ]</p>
<p>Airmead:[ stopped her sister from touching the flower, as it had a trans on her.]</p>
<p> Leviticus :[ Started shivering, even though he wasn’t cold.]</p>
<p>The pups walked passed the spirit flowers, and made their way into a open grassy, cliff life 
place, as vines grew on the short cliffs that had grass and few trees here and there. The pups 
started hearing whispers and starting feeling colder as they walked, it was warm once they 
entered but the air that they breath was cold now . then they seen a large spiritual wolf stand 
before them looking down before them. </p>
<p>Airmead and Leviticus, hid behind Mmamotse, which stood with Aw.

<p>Abysm:[ as his fur flows with no breeze. ]” Young Gods and Goddesses shouldn’t be in the 
Realm of the Spirit World. “</p>
<p>Mmamotse eyes glow. As so does her siblings, they speak in unison. “We come in Peace 
Guardian of souls. “[like they was possessed. ]
</p>
<p>Abysm :[lead the pups out of the spirit realm, and the trans that he held on them faltered. ]</p>
<p>The pups turned to the now normal sized Abysm, looking confused on how they exited the 
cave . </p>
<p>Leviticus :” Who are you? And how come we can’t remember how we got out?”[ In a none 
aggressive tone, but yet more curious tone.]</p>
<p>Abysm:” I am the keeper of souls, the creator of souls , but not life it self, every animal has a 
spiritual connection to me, until that spirit passes away in its Body.”</p>
<p>Airmead:[ sits quietly, a little made that she was possessed without her consent. ]</p>
<br>
Leviticus , Airmead, and Mmamotse leave, and head back home to there mother and father, 
as it was already dark out. Once home the pups greets there parents then settled down in 
their favorite resting stops.
<br>
<p>Mmamotse:[ looks up into the sky, and seen stars streaking across the night time sky. She 
balls up and nuzzle into herself and went to sleep to join the others in the sleeping realm. ]</p>
