  <h3>Snow Part 1</h3>
  <p>
<ul>
Winter was coming soon and lot of animals was preparing to hibernate to fight off 
starvation until the forest was lush green once more. Bears was eating berries and fish , the 
Pica, was harboring grasses for bedding and food supplies, the birds flew out of their home 
to live in a warmer climate, the chipmunks berried the walnuts for the winter, but those who 
stayed behind that wasn’t hibernating or preparing for winter will struggle to survive. Over 
time the trees turn autumn colors and leaves fall everywhere all around the pups, but what was 
the most beautiful place at the time of the year was in the heart of the island where it lays a 
blossom tree , this tree stays bloomed during the winter which feeds the hummingbirds. The 
bubble bees feed off the honey they store for the winter, as it’s too cold to fly out.
<br>
<p>Mmamotse: [wakes up to seeing a large figure in the trees that quickly disappeared 
out of sight, she sniffed , the smell smelt familiar to her but she doesn’t bother to go find 
out what it is. Instead, she rolls over onto her tummy and falls asleep some more using her 
siblings as bed like always .]</p>
<p>Leviticus : [ yawns and stretches and wiggles his way out from under both his sisters, 
as rambunctious as he is he goes out to explore but not far from family where the adults can 
keep a eye on him. He walks up to blossom tree that’s not far from parents at all and looked up 
seeing how large the tree actually was. He goes and wake up his sisters and started playing 
and running around the tree. Vitalis and GreyStorm , rested but was still alert , there ears 
moved where ever the pups moved. ]</p>
<p>Mmamotse: [ see a chipmunk burying a walnut into the ground she runs over scaring 
the chipmunk in the process up the tree which woke up her parents, as the chipmunk sound 
the alarm mmamotse was digging up the walnut and now had it in her mouth chewing on it 
for fun.]
</p>
<p>Vitalis:[rolled onto her paws and stretched she decided to leave GreyStorm with the 
pups alone today as she wanted me time. She walked down the hill that the blossom was on, 
and vanished out of sight.]
</p>
<p>GreyStorm:[ has woken up and realized he had the task of baby sitting today.]</p>
<p>Leviticus : [pulled Airmead tails. And they started chasing one another some more.]</p>
<p>Mmamotse:[ decided that papa can be apart of the fun too, and dropped her walnut 
and pounce on her father biting his ear, he rolls onto his side. But she didn’t stop, she put her 
puppy paw on his face covering his vision. ]
</p>
<p>GreyStorm:[ rolls some more to face her and started tickling her with his nose, seeing 
the young she wolf laughed then gets away and runs behind the tree. He chuckled.]”pups silly 
little things.”</p>
</ul>

Meanwhile….
<br>
<p>Vitalis:[ pushes her way through some pam leaves that was still green, she made it to 
the water fall, she goes into the shallow part of the water and lays in it, she watches the 
autumn leaves fall to the ground all around her.]
</p>
<p>Osiris:” You never looked so beautiful in autumn. “ [as he walks out of his hiding spot. ]
</p>
<p>Vitalis:[ instantly stand up, and growled at him.] “ what do you want? And why are you 
here?”</p>
<p>Osiris:” ooh, now now, I should be the one asking questions, my l-.”[as he gets closer to 
her]</p>
<p>Vitalis:” we aren’t Lover’s, you abandon me and our pups, and now you want to worm 
your way back into our lives, we don’t need you! I suggest y-.”</p>
<p>Osiris:[let out a loud growl]” You unfaithful Bitch, you belong to me and so does the 
pups, you shouldn’t have gone off to find yourself a new mate. Did I give you permission to 
do so?”[ he was now pacing around her, as he knows she knows the rules of a female can’t 
have another mate even if her mate left her, female have no say.]
</p>
<p>Vitalis: [put ears back and shake her head no]” you left me no choice, you made me 
choose my pups life over mine, after you left he came and helped and pups looked up to him 
as if he’s their biological father. “[ she snaps out of the whole he had on her]” I wouldn’t have 
to do that if you didn’t disown us. It’s all your fault ,it doesn’t matter if I moved on, because 
you was never there for us.”[ her Ferocity, has pushed Osiris, into a tree]</p>
<p>Osiris:[Now pin up against a tree, has to change tactics, he kisses her , forcefully 
trying to manipulate her into submission, he pulls her close to him.]
</p>
</ul>

</p>

  <h3>Snow Part 3</h3>
  <p>
<ul>

<p>Vitalis:[ was furious, she pulled away from him scratched him in the face] “ LEAVE 
AND NEVER RETURN!! Go manipulate your other mate, but not me. “[ she leaves the area, and 
goes to a nearby creek to get his sent off of her even going to great lengths of rolling in the 
mud, once she stopped smelling him, she goes back into the creek to clean herself. Then she 
comes out and dry her coat.]</p>
<p>Osiris:[ feeling dumbfounded, of how that just went, he leaves but will be back, he 
hasn’t given up.]</p>
<p>Vitalis : [see a capybara, a few yards down from her, she goes into the tall Reeds and 
grass and started stalking in it. She was capybara feet away from the capybara , she launched 
forward chasing the capybara she pounce on it ,and brings it down, it squeals, then she gives the killer bit, and picks up its lifeless body and brings back to family. We she arrived she was 
eagerly greeted by the pups. She places it down and the pups begin to eat, she was also greeted 
by GreyStorm, and they join the pups.]
</p>
<br>
Meanwhile…
<br>
<p>Osiris:[ made it back to Dawn, which has one pup left. The second pup went missing 
and when found, was dead. He was not amused by the turn of events that took over 6 months 
with this female, he regrets ever leaving Vitalis, but can’t get her back, for now at least he’s 
planning to kill the old male, but not sure how to do so as he’s much larger and powerful then 
he’s. A little Black male pup comes up to his father, to greet him.]” Khorne, how many times I 
tell you not to greet me like a pup, you need to start acting like a dominant male.”</p>
<p>Khorne: “But father , I ju-.”[he coward before his father]</p>
<p>Osiris: [he snarled]“Pathetic.”[he walks away from his son .]
</p>
<p>Khorne:[sits there in tears, and slinks off ,pass his mother that was also trying to 
confront him]” leave me alone!!” [he runs out of sight of his mother. ]
</p>
<p>Dawn:[Khorne, she yelled out to him.]

<p>When dawn came he was dead at the side of a lake. Dawn find him stuck under a tree 
that broke and fell on him killing him instantly. Osiris found Dawn crying over his son’s lifeless 
body. </p>
<p>Dawn:” this is all your fault!! Why could not understand he just wanted your love . 
What is wrong with you!!!?!? “[ She abandons Osiris at the lake, she leaves the territory. She 
looks over her shoulder one more time and was never seen again. ]</p>
<p>The wind howled and the clouds darkened as snow fall was approaching fast now a 
month later, Osiris, was not seen for a long time after losing his son and looking for Dawn, 
but was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Mmamotse:[ wakes up, and stretches and yawn. She sits up and watches a white snow 
flake fall from the sky, and on to her nose which made her wiggle her nose. Then snow flakes 
fallen everywhere, the ground and the trees be came a winter wonder land.]</p>
<p>The pups played in the snow, enjoying their first day of winter. The parents know that 
winter will just get harder and harder until late spring.</p>
