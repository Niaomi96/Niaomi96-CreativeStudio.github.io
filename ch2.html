<ul>

<p>Vitalis :[ returned to den exhausted , with empty tummy, her hunting was unsuccessful for 
today as hunting large game was either to fast or too strong, tomorrow she will have to go 
hunting small game hut for now rest is key.]</p>
<p>She snuggle up to her pups and rested</p>
<p>Vitalis:[wakes up to Leviticus nibbling on her cheek] " Leviticus , sweet stop it, mama trying to 
sleep. "</p>
<p>Leviticus :" mama, I'm hungry but no milk is coming out."</p>
<p>Vitalis : [Sits up and yawns, then stands up and stretches. ] "mama, will be back I'm gonna go 
make some milk." [Concerned was written all over her face while she goes hunting. She forgot 
to usher the pups into the den but luckily they stayed in front of the door.]</p>
<br>
Meanwhile back at the den...

<br>
<p>Mmamotse: [being the bold one as she is, was already trying to seek beyond the tall grass 
but it was too thick for her to get through, she whines a little and her sister Airmead pounces 
on her . Now it's time to play.]</p>
<p>Leviticus :[ picks up a stick and nibbles on it, then picks it up and runs with it to gain his sister 
attention which work. Now he had his sisters chasing him in circles for the stick.]</p>
<p>Airmead: "Gotcha!" [As she bits her brother cheek on his fast. ]

<p>Mmamotse:[ Pounce on both of them, and bits them bother , giggling] "I have both of you 
!!"[she runs over to tree trunk that's broken, she tries to climbed it.]
</p>
<p>Airmead: [ turns and see Mmamotse on top of the trunk]</p>
<p>Mmamotse: "I'm the queen of the tree trunk !"</p>
<p>Leviticus , Airmead , and mmamotse takes turns pushing and rolling off the tree trunk, to be 
the "Queen of the tree trunk." They played all day, until it started to rain, the pups rush back 
in side the den after it rained the pups came(play the rain song) back out playing, but was 
deterred by the wet ground under their soft paws.
</p>
<p>Vitalis: [ returns and the pups comes running over to drink milk, she lays down for them, as 
she hears there smacking of lips as they drink milk.]
</p>
<p>The pups was hungry and with hungry there's aggression while eating. </p>
<p>" Mama mama!" As all the pups said tell us a bed time story, please!!! As they all give there 
mom pup eyes.</p>
<p>Vitalis : "alright right , claim down little ones . Let me tell you of the story of the Mouse and 
the stars. "[As she waved her paws at them] [the pups snuggled up to one another , and stay 
quiet for mom story.]

<ul>

<p>Vitalis: " The mouse climbed ,the tree to the highest point, to gaze at the glistening stars, the 
little mouse always reached as high as he can but never could hold a star within the paws of his 
claws." [ she points to brightest star in the sky.]</p>
<p>Mmamotse: " But mama why does the mouse want the star?"[she stars up at Vitalis ]</p>
<p>Vitalis: " he wants the star to twinkle as bright as it."
</p>
<p>The pups begin to yawn and showing their sleepy faces. 
</p>
<p>Vitalis: "the mouse reaches the star with a leap and they became one . Star shine brighter 
then ever before . The End."[she said softly, as her pups sleep soundly next to her. She stares 
up at the shooting stars gliding across the night time sky .]</p>
<p>Vitalis : [watches her pups , sleep, and sighed..., her heart felt broken, the male she love didn't 
want her or her pups because it was a small litter. A year comes down her cheek.]</p>
<p> Leviticus : "Mamma , What's wrong?"[ he looks up at her with his head titled still having a 
floppy ear .]</p>
<p>Vitalis: [ she smile] " I'm just tired young one, go back to sleep."</p>

  <h3>The Hunt Part 4</h3>
  <p>
<ul>

<p>Leviticus : "ok ,mama." [He nuzzled in his favorite spot between his sisters and falls back to 
sleep]
</p>
<p>Vitalis: [lays her head down and gone to sleep as well.]</p>
<br>
Vitalis wakes up, and leaves the den knowing the tall thick grass will keep the pups in the den 
until they are little bigger where they can follow her around, but for now they are safe at the 
den. She tracked a large kudu male, and started stalking it. Taking her time and calculating 
where to attack, she need larger meals then rabbits to sustain herself and still produce for her 
pups.
She storms out and started chasing it. And nipping at the back legs. The buck now realizing its 
one wolf bucks its legs which made the young she wolf lose her grip, the buck then charges at 
her she cowered. Then a large black male comes in and taken the kudu down for her.
<br>
<p>Unknown male: " why are you hunting alone, females should be back at the den with pups."[ 
he eyed her]
</p>
<p>Vitalis : [started to tear up but , shoved them back down speaking louder then she wanted 
too]" because, he left me for another female, due to only having 3 pups ."
</p>
<p>Unknown Male : " I see. Well you don't need him, I will help raised the pups with you. By the 
way my name is GreyStorm"</p>
<p>Vitalis:" thank you , GreyStorm, but I can handle things myself. " [she said well held her head up 
high.]</p>
<p>GreyStorm: " Said the one who almost got killed by the kudu." [He smirked]
</p>
<p>Vitalis : [rolled her eyes]" fine you can help, also thank you for helping me take down the 
kudu, I really need more food then rabbits. " [she said with gratitude on her face.]

<p>GreyStorm: "Your welcome. I cant wait to meet the Three Musketeers."[as he smiled happily]</p>
<br>
They returned back to pups, Vitalis introduced them to him as there father, the pups looks 
at the large male with excitement and amazement. GreyStorm, didn't correct her, he would be 
happy to be a father, he always wanted to be , especially after never getting to be a alpha 
due to his brother making sure he was under him for 6yrs, so he left ,he got tired of being his 
brother's punching bag, just to make a statement. 
<br>
<p>GreyStorm: [left once everyone was full asleep, went on marking his territory he returned 
back few hours later, and lays next to his new family , falls asleep beside them.]</p>
<p>Osiris: [was patrolling his territory, when he smelled it. He snarled at sent of another male 
who have stake a claim to his female, his jealousy was high. He felt betrayed that his mate was 
unloyal to him. He expected her to stay mate less to no other male except himself. 3/5 of dawn 
pups has perished to illness in pass month, so he was about to leave Dawn like he did to Vitalis 
about 2 weeks ago. ]</p>
