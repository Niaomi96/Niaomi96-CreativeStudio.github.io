<ul>
The pups was now 10 months old, Vitalis and GreyStorm allowed them to roam the 
territory to learn the lay of the land, but also to give GreyStorm and Vitalis Alone time.
<br>
<p>Mmamotse:[ went on her own exploring, as her siblings stick together. She was 
memorized by the flora and fawn before her, as she walked passed by animals sound the 
alarm or run off, she seen a small bear eating termites as she walked on by. Then she sees a 
rabbit, she decided that it’s time to practice what she learned from her parents. She begins 
stalking the rabbits, unaware that she’s being watched by a large aggressive male wolf. She 
gets closer and closer.]
</p>
<p>Large Male:[ Jumps on the young wolf, she gets away from him, however when she 
pulled away from his bit, she lost her ear and his teeth scared her face..]
</p>
<p>Mmamotse: [Held her ground while the male started circling her while blood was 
flowing from her ear and face, blinding her temporarily in her left eye.]
</p>
<p>Large Male:[ lunges at the young she wolf getting her by her arm then tried to go for 
her neck to finish her off, but the young she wolf kicked him off of her. He fell onto his back 
hard.]</p>
<p>Mmamotse:[Now having the upper hand, she lunges on top of the male, pinning his 
dominant arm down under her body, she begins strangling the large male in the neck. His 
paw go free and clawed her shoulder, which the other was trying to reach her ,likewise his 
back legs. She didn’t let go until the male stopped struggling. She gets up believing that the 
male was dead, and pants then walks away. ]</p>
<p>Large Male: [ gets back up slowly but surely, regaining his breath. He rushes over to 
female and snapped down onto her tail.]
</p>
<p>Mmamotse:[ Yelped, then struggled in males grasps to get away. She had enough, and 
turned around and snapped at the Male, tail brakes from her body. From the large amount of 
blood lost the young female Clasps to the ground, shivering and afraid. ]</p>
<p>Large Male:[ as all his focus was on the female Standing over her, debating or not if he 
should kill her, he could take her as his Queen by force, but keep her tied up till she comes 
with the terms. Obviously, to Osiris lunging at him, when he finally seen him it was too late. ]</p>

with his tail between his legs.]</p>

falling back to the ground. She turns around, and seen Osiris, there eyes met. She starts 
backing away forwarding away from him.]</p>
<p>Osiris:[ approaches his, daughter then gets down to her level] “ Easy now, I’m not going 
to hurt you, I came to help you. Mmamotse I-.”</p>

responded. ]</p>
<p>Osiris: “ Yes, tell our daughter while there true father isn’t, apart of there lives.”[ He 
said with a smirk on his lips, hoping that the young female would get upset at her and turn 
on her.]
</p>
<p>Vitalis:[Glared at Osiris. ]” I know what your trying to do Osiris.“[she snarled] “ Your 
father abandoned us, because we didn’t live up to his standards, he wanted a large family, 
and because I had only 3 pups, he ran a coo with another female.”
</p>
<p>Osiris:[ Growl]” Deceitful Bitch.”

in pain, once they got home Vitalis, worked on healing her daughter, but due too the scars 
being so deep, she couldn’t heal it completely , only her daughter could, and she wont get her 
powers till she a yearling.

the ice . She put her only ear back then kicked the snow onto the ice then walked 
away.](song play here{ Christina Aguilera - Reflection (2020) (From "Mulan")}.)[ mmamotse 
walks around in the snowy paradise singing. ]</p>
<br>

<p>Leviticus:” Don’t say that Airmead, do you remember when you got hurt?”[he looked 
at his sister]</p>
