<ul>
The pups was now yearlings , which was a coming of age for them. The snow melts off the 
trees and ground, and the ground and trees coming abundant and bountiful for all creatures 
that inhabits the island, the birds have returned and sing their songs.
<br>
<p>Vitalis and GreyStorm taken the yearlings out for hunting. They lead them to a herd in their 
forest. The adults, lead the hunt but doesn’t interfere. 
</p>
<p>Airmead: [ got the herd going by growling and barking and mock charging. ]</p>
<p>Mmamotse: [ comes out chasing with Airmead. ]</p>
<p>Leviticus : [ laid in waiting, for the herd to come to him.]</p>
<br>
The girls snapped at the herd, while the parents followed behind. Mmamotse and Airmead, 
got one deer to break from the herd. Leviticus jumps from his hiding, and him and the girls 
brought down their pray. The parents come rushing over to eat with the pups, everyone dig
in , then found a nice spot to rest at.
<br>
<p>Vitalis: [ watched a peacock dancing and showing his beautiful feathers to a female.]</p>
<p>Mmamotse:[ Started to glow brightly, and transformed, her scars healed, but her missing 
body parts hasn’t. Her wings, shown half angel , half dragon, she lands onto her paws.] “ I am 
Goddess of night and day, the keeper of dreams, the lining of stars and moons, and rising of 
stars.”[ as her eyes glowed then dimmed. She looked at her at a puddle of water.]
</p>
<p>Leviticus : [ started to glow as well, but no wings was shown.]”I am God ,of chaos and weather 
on planetary and universal weather. ”[ He felt the powers coursing through his vines, he 
started walking in air, and Mmamotse joined him in flight giggling and having fun.]</p>
<p>Airmead: [ started feeling left out, then started to glow herself, she transformed, and had 
angel wings ] “ I am the goddess of the oceans and seas. “ [ she takes flight to join her siblings 
and flies around heaving fun.]

The yearlings, landed on the ground, then their wings went away. Vitalis was proud seeing 
how far they have came and knowing their less likely to die now from a predator. After a long 
day, Mmamotse, raised the moon and set the sun, and a line the stars. They all went to sleep, 
the pups woken up early and went off to practice their powers, the sunlight hitting the forest 
ground and Mmamotse, up on a tree spreading her wings while she rises the sun hitting her 
fur, the wind blowing against her fur
<br>
<p>Vitalis: [ wakes, up from the sun light hitting her face, she yawns then stretches.] “ time to get 
up love.”[ she said with a smile, but it quickly changed when she touched him with her paw, 
he was cold and unresponsive, he has passed. Her wings show, and she rises his spirit from 
his body and he floats up and out of sight, not after smiling at her.](song play :{EVANESCENCE
